1. Overview
--------------------------------------------------
Cut and Paste 
- Helps you move assets quickly and easily 

Why did we develop this tool?
- We have constantly dealt with big projects which contained so many assets that it was very hard for us to move assets with Drag and Drop operations.

If you have had the same issue as us, this is the tool for you.

Features:
- Adds "Cut Assets" and "Paste Assets" options to assets context menu.
- Supports moving multiple assets at the same time.
- The .meta file will not be changed after the move.
